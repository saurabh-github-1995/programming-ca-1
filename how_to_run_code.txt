Steps to run code:
1.Open the final_code.ipynb or final_code.py file and run the code
2.Call addStudentToList() method with data in dictionary format as follows
	addStudentToList({"name":"Saurabh","number":99999991,"subjCode":"ABCDEFG"})

	for i in range(10000):
		#print(i)
	   
		student={"name":"Saurabh","number": randrange(10000000, 99999999),"subjCode":"ABCDEFG"}
		addStudentToList(student)
